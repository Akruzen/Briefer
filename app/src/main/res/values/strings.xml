    <string name="about_bert">
        Google released mobileBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 aiming for high performance
        lightweight Natural Language Processing for processors having limited resources such as those of smartphones. It is based
        on Tensorflow Lite model which can be used to build a system that can answer users\' questions in natural language. In 2022,
        Google launched an non-compiled proof-of-concept application on GitHub for showcasing BERT\'s usage on Android smartphones.
        This app uses the same BERT technology under the hood.

    <string name="how_to_use">
        Tap the \"+\" button on home screen of the app to add a topic. Then, enter a suitable title for your text and paste/type in
        your text content. Tap Save icon. The title of your text will appear in the home screen list. Tap the list item. You can now
        ask questions based on the text content you had inserted.
    </string>
    <string name="points_to_consider">
        Take a note of the following points while you ask questions:\n\n
        1. The model cannot generate text on its own. Hence, the results will always be a part of the text you have provided.\n
        2. Since text generation is not possible, questions like \"Summarize the paragraph\", \"Predict the outcome\" or any such
        similar queries will produce garbage results.\n
        3. From a list of results, top 5 results are shown, where first is most likely and 5th is least likely.\n
        4. Try phrasing your questions in such a way, that they end in a question mark and start with a \"Wh\" type word.
        For example, instead of asking \"Do you know the CEO of Google?\" or \"Tell me the name of CEO of Google.\", ask
        \"Who is the CEO of Google?\"

    <string name="threads_info">
        Threads are used to improve performance by allowing multiple operations to run simultaneously.
        Increasing number of threads might increase computing speed but it depends on number of cores the delegate has.\n
        A Delegate is a software component that can be used to accelerate the execution of TensorFlow Lite models.
        Delegates can be used to leverage on-device accelerators such as the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), CPU (Central Processing
        Unit), and NNAPI (Android Neural Networks API).

    <string name="threads_warning">Warning: These settings usually don\'t require alterations. Only proceed if you know what you are doing.</string>
    <string name="about_app_detail">You\'ll need to type in some sentences, and then you can ask questions to get shorter
        answers from those sentences. Remember, the answers will need to be present in those sentences. This is useful for storing useful information
        like your identity number, name of your favourite vendor or perhaps where did you park your car before you went to that
        shop you were trying to go in a while. This way, unlike other apps, you won\'t
        need to search for exact words. Just ask as if you would ask a person! 😃</string>
